# ColdFusion examples

Example code for ColdFusion.


## Database

- SQL select and insert [queries](./query.cfm).


## Flow control

- [If-elseif-else](./if.cfm) tag and script examples.

- [Include](./include.cfm) other templates.


## Railo vs Adobe ColdFusion

These are some issues that have caught me out.

- Railo allows a final trailing comma in objects.
  `a = {a=1, b=2,};` is no good in Adobe.

- Railo does not require semicolons on line endings.
  `a = {a=1, b=2}` is no good in Adobe.

- [CFDocs](https://cfdocs.org/) are a lot nicer than the Adobe ones.
